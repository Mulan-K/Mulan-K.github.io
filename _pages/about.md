Welcome to DML. My research focuses on computational detonation, with an emphasis on the following areas:

Detonation physics
======
1. three-dimensional effects
1. rotating detonation waves
1. shock-bubble interaction
1. re-initiation after diffraction
1. vibrationally non-equilibrium

Scientific computing
======
1. high-performance computing
1. adaptive mesh refinement
1. numerical methods

Other
======
1. micro flapping vehicles
1. particle image velocimetry
